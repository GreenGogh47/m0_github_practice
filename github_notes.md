# GitHub Notes

To check your own understanding of GitHub, answer the questions that follow.

1. **What is the purpose of GitHub?** It's like a save point in a game. So I can return to different points in the game/story with different equipment and choices made.
1. **What is the difference between forking and cloning a repository?** Forking is creating my own version of a repository on GitHub, while cloning is copying a repository onto my machine. So it seems that typically I'm going to fork a repo, then clone it.
